# Terra.js

Terra.js seeks to provide a compatible way to work with the Terra blockchain within JavaScript runtimes, such as Node.js and the browser. Terra.js enables the following functions:

- Deserializing blockchain data into JavaScript objects with native data types and methods
- Serializing objects back into a blockchain-compatible format
- Providing access to the `terrad` node API (LCD) from a JavaScript-based interface
- Providing additional utilities, such as hash functions and key-signing algorithms
