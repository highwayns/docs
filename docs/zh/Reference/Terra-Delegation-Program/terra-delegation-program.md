# Terra Delegation Program

A reliable community of validators forms the strong foundation of the Terra network. To support this community and to keep it vibrant, Terraform Labs is dedicated to delegating Luna from its treasury to facilitate a more decentralized, efficient, and secure network via the Terra Delegation Program.

Validators are encouraged to apply for the Terra Delegation Program. Validators that qualify will receive a delegation from Terraform Labs. To participate in the Terra Delegation Program, validators must meet specific requirements.
